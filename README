Demonstrating OAuth for a twitter tool in Perl.

# Another example script (which is packaged with a valid consumer_key
# and consumer_secret):
http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/MMIMS/Net-Twitter-3.18001/examples/oauth_desktop.pl



PROBLEMS:

You need to register the script with twitter to get the consumer_key
and consumer_secret for your copy of the app (Twitter don't like you
to make them 'public').

If you get the following error while trying to authenticate as a user:

    GET https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token failed: 500 read failed:  at ./twitter.pl line 44


you may need to update LWP::Protocol::https
